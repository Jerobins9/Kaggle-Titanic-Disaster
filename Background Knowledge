**Background**
The RMS Titanic was a luxury streamship that sank on the 15th of April 1912, off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlanic. 
After a collision with an iceberg while en route to New York City from Southampton, England. 
There were a recorded 2,240 passengers and crew on board for the voyage and a total of 1504 lost their lives.

This project was initially written as a submission for the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" Competition. 
This challenge called for participants to predict whether a passenger on the titanic would survive based on passenger data from the event. 
The Titanic dataset provided a diverse amount of information about passengers such as socio-economic status, gender, age, survival and more.

This project will display a full walkthrough of the procress of creating a machine learning model, data exploration, data cleaning 
and analysis through various classification methods.

Classification methods used

*1. Logistics Regression
*2. Random Forest
*3. Decision Tree
*4. K Nearest Neighbor
