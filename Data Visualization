Data Visualization

Data visualization is a useful tool for data cleaning as it can assist with detecting outliers, missing values, implicit boundaries and much more. 
In this case I will be using it to check the effectiveness of my data cleaning methods as well as correlating various related features.

Age Vs Survival

Throughout the cleaning process I noticed a few relationships between age and survival. 
Most passangers in this data set are in the age range 15-35 years old. 
The oldest surviving passanger was 80 years old and children under the age of 4 had a high survival rate.

'''
age_hist = sns.FacetGrid(train_df, col= 'Survived')
age_hist.map(plt.hist, 'Age', bins = 20, color = "Orange")
'''

Survival Classified by Age and Passenger Class
'''
grid = sns.FacetGrid(train_df, col = 'Survived', row = 'Pclass', size = 2.2, aspect = 1.6)
grid.map(plt.hist, 'Age', alpha = .5, bins = 20, color = "Orange")
grid.add_legend();
'''

Surviral by Sex, Passenger Class and Embarking Port
Next I explored the correlation between sex,passenger class, embarking port and survival.
I found that Female passengers had a higher survival rate across all aspects. 
However, males that embarked at port C were more likely to survive then males that embarked at ports S and Q.

'''
grid = sns.FacetGrid(train_df, row='Embarked', size=2.2, aspect=1.6)
grid.map(sns.pointplot, 'Pclass', 'Survived', 'Sex', palette='deep')
grid.add_legend()
